# Next, copy in your strip_punctuation function and define a function called get_pos which takes one parameter, a string which represents one or more sentences, and calculates how many words in the string are considered positive words. Use the list, positive_words to determine what words will count as positive. The function should return a positive integer - how many occurrences there are of positive words in the text. Note that all of the words in positive_words are lower cased, so you’ll need to convert all the words in the input string to lower case as well.

punctuation_chars = ["'", '"', ",", ".", "!", ":", ";", '#', '@']


def strip_punctuation(word):
    for char in punctuation_chars:
        word = word.replace(char, "")
    return word


words_to_use = ["happy", "laugh", "smile", "joy", "joyous"]
positive_words = []
with open("positive_words.txt") as pos_f:
    for lin in pos_f:
        if lin[0] != ';' and lin[0] != '\n':
            positive_words.append(lin.strip())
print(positive_words)
